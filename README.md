## Features / Tutorials

### Build kdtree and radius search

1. `Build Kdtree` builds a kd-tree (`Kdtree` object in Blueprint) from `Vector` objects.
   * `Dump Kdtree to Console` outputs the internal information of `Kdtree` object to the console for debugging.
   * `Validate Kdtree` checks the `Kdtree` object and halts the game play if there is a incorrect in it. 
2. `Collect from Kdtree` collects `Vector` objects in the sphere (center location is `Center`, radius is `Radius`). `Collect from Kdtree` also returns indicies of list that is input argument of `Build Kdtree`.
3. If you don't use `Kdtree` any more, you can destroy `Kdtree` object and free memories by `Clear Kdtree`.

### Build kdtree and radius search (Async version)

Async version is also provided by this plugin.

1. `Build Kdtree Async` is an asynchronous version of `Build Kdtree`.
   * All synchronous versions (`Collect from Kdtree`, `Dump Kdtree to Console`, `Validate Kdtree` and `Clear Kdtree`) can be applicatable to `Kdtree` object after `Build Kdtree Async` is completed.
2. `Collect from Kdtree Async` is an asynchronous version of `Collect from Kdtree`.
